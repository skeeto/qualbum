# Quick Album Generator

Qualbum is a single Python script that generates a static photo album
website from a collection of images. Images are be grouped into
galleries with other images in the same directory.

* [**Demo Gallery**](http://nullprogram.com/qualbum/)

Except for the root "gallery" that contains every image, each gallery
must have a `_gallery.yaml` in its directory with `title` and
(optionally) `image` fields. Galleries are sorted newest first. Each
gallery gets its own Atom feed and is will appear in an albums listing.

Each image must be accompanied by a Markdown `.md` file with the same
name. This file has a YAML "front matter" providing basic metadata for
the image (title, date, etc.), and is followed by a free-form
description of the image in Markdown.

The "Favorite Colors" (`colors/`) gallery in serves as a basic example.

## Installation, setup, and build

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

    $ python -m venv .
    $ source bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Build your album site:

    $ python qualbum.py
